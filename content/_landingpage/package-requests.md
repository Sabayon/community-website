### Package Requests

To fill a Package request
[file a bug](https://bugs.sabayon.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community%20Repositories)
in the Sabayon Bugzilla.

There are three types of requests that can be filed that will be considered
by a SCRD:

* **Orphan Request**:
  Request a package to be disowned, e.g. when the maintainer is inactive and
  the package has been flagged out-of-date for a long time.

* **Deletion Request**:
  Request a package to be removed from the Community repository in SCR.
  Please do not use this if a package is broken and can be fixed easily.
  Instead, contact the package maintainer and file orphan request if necessary.

* **Add a package**:
  Request a package to be inside Community SCR.
  SCRD will decide what to do then, if you intend to mantain it,
  specify it in the issue.

#### Submitting Packages

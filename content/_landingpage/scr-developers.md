### SCR Developers

SCR Developers (SCRD) are members of the community charged with keeping the SCR
in working order.
They maintain popular packages (communicating with and sending patches
upstream as needed), and vote in administrative matters.

A SCRD is elected from active community members by current SCRDs in a
democratic process.
SCRDs are the only members who have a final say in the direction of the SCR.

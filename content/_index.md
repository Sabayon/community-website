# Sabayon Community Repositories

{{< searchpackage >}}

The Sabayon Community Repositories (SCR) is a community-driven collection of
repositories for Sabayon users.

It contains packages built and kept up-to-date by the SCR Build System
that allow you to install a package directly with equo.

The SCR was created to keep in a clean and well state the Entropy
main repositories, with the goal to reduce it's size and impact.
The SCR is the infrastructure to organize and share new packages from the
community and to also build popular packages into the community repository.

SCR contains mostly packages that can be found in Gentoo Overlays (layman) and
that cannot be maintained by the Sabayon Dev team.
In the SCR, users are able also to contribute their own package builds
(ebuilds and related files).
The SCR community has the ability to vote for or against packages/repositories
in the SCR Build System.
All the repositories provides packages in the binary form.
